To make a light tempura batter, whisk the @egg{1}(large) into the @cold water{300%ml} with the @salt{pinch} and then add the @flour{200%g}, whisking only briefly to ensure a light, crisp batter.

Heat some @vegetable oil{} in a #wok, deep frying pan or deep-fryer{} to a temperature of 190Â°C.

When a little of the batter drops halfway before floating on top, the temperature is right. (If it drops to the bottom, it is too cold.)

Put the @vegetables in the batter. Take them out one at a time, shake once to ensure they are only very lightly coated and lower them into the oil. Cook for between ~{1-3%minutes}, depending on the vegetable, turning each piece once. Cook vegetables of similar cooking time together.

Drain on kitchen paper before serving with a dip, such as a simple one of light soy sauce and grated ginger or wasabi.
