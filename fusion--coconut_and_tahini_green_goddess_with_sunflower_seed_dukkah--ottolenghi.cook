introduction: This is a great way to use leftover herbs. Feel free to substitute with whatever herbs you have in the fridge. The sunflower seed dukkah is very addictive, youâ€™ll want to sprinkle it on everything. If you like, make double the amount and store the excess in an airtight jar where it will keep for up to 2 weeks.
