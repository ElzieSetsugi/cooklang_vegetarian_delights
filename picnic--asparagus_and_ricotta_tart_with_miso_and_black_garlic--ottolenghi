Heat the #oven{} to 190C (180C fan).

In a #small bowl{}, combine the @ricotta{150%g}, @parmesan{25%g}(finely grated, plus extra finely grated to serve), one of the @egg yolks{2}, the @white miso{1%tbsp} and a good grind of @pepper{}, and set aside. Put the @black garlic{6%cloves}(roughly chopped), @balsamic vinegar{1.5%tbsp}, two tablespoons of @olive oil{2.5%tbsp} and a teaspoon of water in the small bowl of a food processor and blitz smooth, scraping the sides of the bowl a few times as you go.

Line a #large baking tray{} with #greaseproof paper{} and lay the @puff pastry{320%g}(35cm x 22cm sheet all-butter puff pastry, rolled out) sheet on top, with the longer side facing you. Create a rim on the pastry by lightly scoring it about 1 cm from the edge all the way around. Gently poke the center randomly with a fork about 12 times in all. 

Spread the ricotta mixture evenly over the center, then top with the @asparagus{250%g}(fine asparagus, ends trimmed and discarded) tips, all pointing in the same direction and away from you, with some tips slightly overlapping the others. Drizzle over the remaining teaspoon and a half of oil, and lightly sprinkle the asparagus with @salt{} and @pepper{}.

Add a small splash of water to the remaining egg yolk, beating to combine, and use this to brush all around the rim.

Bake for ~{25-28%minutes}, or until the pastry is golden around the edges and cooked through. Transfer the tart to a large board, spoon over the black garlic dressing, sprinkle with the @chilli{1/4%tsp} and extra parmesan, then cut into eight pieces. Serve warm or at room temperature.
